# CatFactory.AspNetCore ==^^==

This is the *CatFactory* package for *ASP.NET Core*.

## What Is CatFactory?

CatFactory is a scaffolding engine for .NET Core built with C#.

## How does it Works?

The concept behind CatFactory is to import an existing database from SQL Server instance and then to scaffold a target technology.

We can also replace the database from SQL Server instance with an in-memory database.

The flow to import an existing database is:

1. Create Database Factory
2. Import Database
3. Create instance of Project (Entity Framework Core, Dapper, etc)
4. Build Features (One feature per schema)
5. Scaffold objects, these methods read all objects from database and create instances for code builders
